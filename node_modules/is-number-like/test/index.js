# Diff

Diff implementation for PHP, factored out of PHPUnit into a stand-alone component.

## Installation

To add this package as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `sebastian/diff` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on Diff:

    {
        "require": {
            "sebastian/diff": "*"
        }
    }

### Usage

The `Differ` class can be used to generate a textual representation of the difference between two strings:

```php
use SebastianBergmann\Diff\Differ;

$differ = new Differ;
print $differ->diff('foo', 'bar');
```

The code above yields the output below:

    --- Original
    +++ New
    @@ @@
    -foo
    +bar

The `Parser` class can be used to parse a unified diff into an object graph:

```php
use SebastianBergmann\Diff\Parser;
use SebastianBergmann\Git;

$git = new Git('
